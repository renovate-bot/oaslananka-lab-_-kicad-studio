# Phase v2.6.0-3 Summary

## Scope

- Added `QualityGateProvider`.
- Registered the `kicadstudio.qualityGate` sidebar view and quality gate commands.
- Added project, placement, transfer, and manufacturing MCP wrapper calls.
- Added cache rendering through workspace state and DRC-triggered debounced refresh.

## Commands Run

- `npm run lint` - passed.
- `npm run typecheck` - passed.
- `npm run test:unit` - passed, 275 tests.
- `npm run compile-tests` - passed after adding `src/**/*.d.ts` to `tsconfig.test.json`.

## Results

- Gate status mapping and violation child rows are covered by unit tests.
- Integration manifest coverage confirms the view and commands are contributed.
- `assets/screenshots/quality-gates.png` exists as a generated quality-gates dashboard mock pending a fresh dev-host capture.

## Diff Counts

- Main files: `src/providers/qualityGateProvider.ts`, `src/mcp/mcpClient.ts`, `src/commands/qualityGateCommands.ts`, `package.json`, `assets/screenshots/quality-gates.png`.
- Tests: `test/unit/qualityGateProvider.test.ts`, `test/integration/qualityGate.flow.test.ts`.

## Deferred Follow-ups

- Capture a fresh quality-gates screenshot against a live MCP server and replace the generated mock.
