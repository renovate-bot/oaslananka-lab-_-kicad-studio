# Contributing To KiCad Studio

## Development Setup

1. Install Node.js `24.14.1`, pnpm `11.0.8`, and VS Code 1.99+.
2. Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
3. Press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host.
4. Let the Git hooks handle fast staged checks on commit and run `pnpm run check` before push.
5. Run `pnpm run check:ci` when you want the closest local equivalent of the primary CI package gate.
6. Run `pnpm test` before sending substantial changes when the integration host is available.
7. Run `pnpm run test:e2e` for the desktop smoke suite when a Windows desktop session is available.
