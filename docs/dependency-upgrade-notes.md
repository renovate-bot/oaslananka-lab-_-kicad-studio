| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| #1  | `semver`, `@commitlint/*`, `@typescript-eslint/*`, `@vscode/vsce`, `prettier`, `@types/vscode` | Partially applied. Kept `@types/vscode` on `1.99.x` to match `engines.vscode: ^1.99.0`.           |
| #2  | `webpack-cli` 6 to 7                                                                           | Applied; Node 24 satisfies the major's engine range and package validation covers build behavior. |
| #3  | `jest-util` 29 to 30                                                                           | Postponed with Jest 30.                                                                           |
| #4  | `@types/node` 20 to 25                                                                         | Rejected for now; runtime target remains Node 24.x. Updated to Node 24 typings instead.           |
| #5  | `jest` and `@types/jest` 29 to 30                                                              | Postponed; Jest 30 migration needs a dedicated extension test-runner pass.                        |
| #6  | `eslint` 9 to 10                                                                               | Postponed; ESLint 10 migration should be scheduled with config changes and CI parity.             |
| #7  | `lint-staged` 16 to 17                                                                         | Applied; Node 24 satisfies the major's engine range.                                              |
| #8  | `github/codeql-action` patch                                                                   | Reviewed as safe patch input; workflow pin updates remain controlled by workflow validation.      |
| #10 | `actions/labeler` 5 to 6                                                                       | Reviewed as acceptable major input; no direct workflow change was required in this branch.        |
| #11 | `c8` 10 to 11                                                                                  | Applied; Node 24 satisfies the major's engine range.                                              |
| #12 | `@eslint/js` 9 to 10                                                                           | Postponed with ESLint 10.                                                                         |
| #13 | `actions/checkout` pinned SHA update                                                           | Reviewed as safe patch input; existing pinned checkout usage remains intact.                      |
| #14 | `actions/stale` 9 to 10                                                                        | Reviewed as acceptable major input; no direct workflow change was required in this branch.        |

## Postponed Major Updates

| Dependency                                | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TypeScript 6                              | Postponed to avoid compiler and lint churn in the same release-hardening branch. `typescript-eslint` 8.59.x supports TS 6, but the repo remains on a conservative TS 5.9.x baseline for this pass. |
| ESLint 10 and `@eslint/js` 10             | Postponed until the flat config migration can be validated on all matrix runners.                                                                                                                  |
| Jest 30, `@types/jest` 30, `jest-util` 30 | Postponed until unit, integration, mocks, and extension host tests are migrated together.                                                                                                          |
| `@types/node` 25                          | Rejected for now because the runtime target is Node 24.x.                                                                                                                                          |
| `@types/vscode` 1.118                     | Rejected for now because the extension minimum remains `engines.vscode: ^1.99.0`.                                                                                                                  |

## Socket Review

Socket comments were reviewed on the dependency PRs visible in the organization repository.
