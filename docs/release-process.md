# Release Process

Releases are created from the canonical `oaslananka-lab/kicad-studio`
repository. The personal `oaslananka/kicad-studio` repository is a showcase
mirror and is never the release authority.

## Source Of Truth

- release-please manifest mode controls version selection.
- Conventional Commit history determines SemVer bumps.
- `.release-please-manifest.json` records the current release state.
- `release-please-config.json` defines the package metadata and changelog path.
- Maintainers do not enter release versions manually.

## Workflow

1. A qualifying commit lands on `main`.
2. `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs release-please.
3. If a release PR is needed, release-please opens or updates it.
4. After the release PR is merged, release-please creates the GitHub Release.
5. Asset jobs build the VSIX from a clean runner checkout.
6. The workflow generates `SHA256SUMS.txt`, `sbom.cdx.json`, and provenance.
7. Assets are attached to the GitHub Release and verified.
8. Registry publishing runs from the release tag when release outputs indicate a
   release was created.

Manual workflow dispatch is available for diagnostics only and accepts no
version input.

Required secrets:

- `VSCE_PAT`
- `OVSX_PAT`
- `DOPPLER_GITHUB_SERVICE_TOKEN` only if maintainers later replace the default
  `github.token` GitHub Release flow with a service-token fallback

Supporting secrets:

- `CODECOV_TOKEN` for coverage upload only
- `PERSONAL_REPO_PUSH_TOKEN` for one-way showcase mirroring only
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` only when source maps are uploaded

Before release triage, inspect the state machine:

```bash
GH_TOKEN=<token> node scripts/release-state.mjs --repo oaslananka-lab/kicad-studio --json
```

`safe_to_publish` is advisory and conservative. Publishing authority remains in
`.github/workflows/release.yml` and its release-please outputs.
