# Changelog

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Scoped KiCad Studio view-title actions correctly so they no longer leak into unrelated VS Code view headers.
- Fixed the viewer webview bootstrap script generation so PCB and schematic custom editors no longer stall before the render pipeline starts.
- Minimal KiCad 10 schematic and PCB files now attempt KiCanvas and CLI SVG fallback rendering before showing the empty-document overlay.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- Moved the heavy viewer stylesheet into a bundled media asset so the production extension bundle stays under the release regression gate.

### Fixed

- Schematic and PCB viewers now fall back to CLI-generated SVG when KiCanvas reports success but renders blank or fails to produce a drawable surface.
- Fallback viewers now preserve KiCad-like backgrounds, stable zoom/pan behavior, and persistent tool buttons across schematic and PCB documents.
- Viewer loading no longer briefly flashes transient KiCanvas HUD controls before the final render mode is ready.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Language Model Tools contributions for DRC/ERC, Gerber export, file opening, component/library search, active-context reads, and variant listing/switching.
- `kicadstudio.manageChatProvider` plus a Claude-backed Language Model Chat Provider contribution for VS Code hosts that support chat-provider registration.
- MCP server definition provider contribution so compatible VS Code builds can discover `kicad-mcp-pro` without requiring `.vscode/mcp.json`.
- Baseline-driven bundle-size regression checks with `scripts/bundle-size-baseline.json`.
- CI dependency auditing via `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`.

### Changed

- Bumped the extension version to `2.4.0`.
- MCP bootstrap now supports explicit profile selection and `pipx` detection fallback.
- MCP HTTP transport now follows Streamable HTTP expectations, including `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` and `MCP-Session-Id` reuse.
- Viewer and webview message handling now performs stricter runtime validation before acting on inbound payloads.
- Activation logging now emits a warning when startup exceeds 500 ms.
- README and docs were refreshed for LM tools, chat-provider support, Streamable HTTP MCP behavior, and KiCad 10 guidance.

### Fixed

- Hardened the Playwright VS Code smoke-test harness cleanup path for Windows temp directories so release validation no longer fails on transient `EPERM` cleanup locks.
- `kicad-cli` runner now supports cancellation-aware progress flows, typed exit errors, and KiCad text-variable expansion through `--define-var`.
- Component search, variant helpers, and LM/MCP registrations now have unit and integration coverage for the new branches introduced in the 2.4.0 work.
- Webview CSPs now avoid inline/eval allowances while keeping all scripts nonce-gated.

### Removed

- The stale placeholder release-notes section so the changelog maps directly to shipped versions.

## [2.3.3] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Hardened the Playwright VS Code smoke-test harness cleanup path for Windows temp directories so release validation no longer fails on transient `EPERM` cleanup locks.
