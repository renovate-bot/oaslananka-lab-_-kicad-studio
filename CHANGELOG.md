# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Fixed

- KiCad document parsing now coalesces duplicate parse requests.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-14

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- Azure DevOps pipelines now use `UseNode@1` instead of deprecated `NodeTool@0` to remove deprecation warnings in CI and publish jobs.
